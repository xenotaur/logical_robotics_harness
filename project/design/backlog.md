# Design Backlog

Lightweight list of deferred ideas that are not yet ready for a formal
proposal or work item. Each entry should record what was noted, why it was
deferred, and where it came from so a future reader can act on it without
re-deriving context.

## Validator drift-check for synced skill references

**Noted:** 2026-06-30, during `WS-PRIOR-ART-CHECK` design session.

**Idea:** Extend `lrh validate` (or a small standalone script) to diff each
consuming skill's copy of a shared reference doc against the `_shared/`
master and fail on drift — replacing the comment-only sync convention
currently used for `prior-art-check.md` copies.

**Status:** Deferred — not in scope for `WS-PRIOR-ART-CHECK`. The current
approach is a header comment in each copy naming the master file. Revisit
if copies are observed drifting in practice.

## `/lrh-decision` skill for authoring `project/memory/decisions/*.md` files

**Noted:** 2026-07-05, during design and implementation of
`WI-DECISION-RECORD-CONVENTIONS`.

**Idea:** A skill (parallel to `/lrh-work-item` and `/lrh-proposal`) that
interviews the user and writes a new `project/memory/decisions/<slug>.md`
file — following the `Context` / `Options considered` / `Decision` /
`Invariants` / `Consequences` shape and the `DEC-*` id convention — for a
decision that resolves an ambiguity or contradiction in existing docs or
implementation. Distinct from `/lrh-proposal`, which proposes new design
direction under a proposed/adopted lifecycle; `/lrh-decision` would record a
decision that's already effectively made, promoted out of
`project/memory/decision_log.md` because other documents need to cite it
independently and repeatedly.

**Status:** Deferred — only one promoted decision file exists in this repo
(`project/memory/decisions/precedence_semantics.md`). The interview
questions and body-section shape can't be specified with confidence from a
single instance; a synthetic second file would prove nothing. Revisit once a
second `project/memory/decisions/*.md` file is created by hand and the
promotion pattern (see `design.md` §14 "Decision-record tiers") has a real
second data point.

**Related:** `project/work_items/resolved/WI-DECISION-RECORD-CONVENTIONS.md`
Non-Goals; `project/design/design.md` §14 "Decision-record tiers"; `project/memory/decisions/precedence_semantics.md`.
