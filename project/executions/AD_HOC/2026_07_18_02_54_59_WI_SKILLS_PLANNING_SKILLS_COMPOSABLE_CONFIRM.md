# Summary

Pre-merge verification of PR #399 (`WI-SKILLS-PLANNING-SKILLS-COMPOSABLE`)
via `/lrh-confirm-fixes` — this skill's first real-world run.

# Result

No review threads existed to verify or resolve. Confirmed via two
independent sources, per Decision 12: `lrh request review_response` reported
`Nothing to resolve:`, and the authoritative
`lrh github threads --mode raw --state all` (filtered client-side to
`isResolved == false`) returned zero threads total. No discrepancy between
the two — nothing was silently missed.

Thread-resolution verdict: **green — nothing to verify** (trivial case).

**Bug found during this run, not fixed here (out of scope for #399):** the
skill's documented CI-check command, `gh pr checks <pr-url> --required
--json name,state,bucket`, errored with "no required checks reported on the
branch" — this repo has no branch-protection rule marking any check
`required`, so the `--required` filter has nothing to match and the command
fails entirely rather than returning an empty/unfiltered result. Worked
around manually this run by falling back to `gh pr checks <pr-url> --json
name,state,bucket` (unfiltered): all 5 checks (`coverage`,
`installed-wheel-smoke`, `lint`, `Check workflow files`, `tests`) reported
`SUCCESS`. Flagged as a background task (`task_b1fec5d4`, "Fix gh pr checks
--required fallback in lrh-confirm-fixes") rather than fixed inline, since
the fix touches unrelated already-merged code
(`src/lrh/skills/lrh-confirm-fixes/`) on a branch scoped to #399's own
unrelated work.

# Validation

```
lrh validate  — 0 errors, 0 warnings
lrh request review_response <pr-url>  — "Nothing to resolve"
lrh github threads <pr-url> --mode raw --state all  — 0 threads total (live-verified, matches above)
gh pr checks <pr-url> --json name,state,bucket (fallback, --required unusable on this repo)  — 5/5 SUCCESS
```

# Follow-up

- Update `session_transcript: pending` to `claude-app:<session-id>` after the
  session ends.
- Pick up `task_b1fec5d4` (the `--required` fallback fix) whenever
  convenient — independent of this PR.
- Final readiness verdict and merge one-liner reported separately (Step 8),
  once this record's commit is the checked `HEAD`.
