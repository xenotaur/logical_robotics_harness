# Roadmap

The harness should be built in stages, with the earliest stages proving the project model and local
workflow before deeper agent integration.

## Phase 1 — Control Plane

Define and implement the project control model:
- principles
- goal
- roadmap
- focus
- work items
- evidence
- status

Exit condition:
- LRH can parse and validate a project directory and expose its contents coherently.

## Phase 2 — Runtime and Workspace

Add project-repo interaction:
- workspace discovery
- workspace adapter interface
- CLI surface
- end-to-end handling of a target repository

Exit condition:
- LRH can run against a sample project repository and identify current focus and work queue.

## Phase 3 — Execution, Evidence, and Status

Add operational behavior:
- work item execution scaffolding
- evidence recording
- synthesized status
- run artifacts

Exit condition:
- LRH can execute a bounded workflow and produce evidence-backed status.

## Phase 4 — MCP and Agent Integration

Add external orchestration capability:
- MCP integration
- tool registry
- agent runtime abstraction
- guardrail and approval controls

Exit condition:
- LRH can act as a practical harness around external tools and agent runtimes.
